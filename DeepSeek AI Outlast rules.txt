Streamlined Rules for OUTLAST by DeepSeek AI

Core Focus: Maintain learning objectives while reducing complexity and enhancing player engagement.

Simplified Player Turn

Actions per Turn: 3 actions + 1 per settlement (not per meeple).
Why? Reduces micromanagement and ties growth to strategic building, not just population.

Streamlined Actions

Move/Explore
Move to an adjacent tile. If unexplored (face-down), flip it and resolve effects.
No extra action cost for revealing tiles.
Gather
Resources: Collect 1 resource per action (max 3/tile).
Hunt Prey: Roll d8. 5+ = gain 1 prey. 1-4 = failure. Costs 1 action.
Combined hunting and gathering simplifies choices.
Build
Spend 2 resources (down from 3) to construct a settlement.
Settlements grant +1 action/turn and spawn new meeples.
Defend or Hide (when on a tile with a wolf)
Fight: Roll d8. 7+ = defeat wolf. 1-6 = meeple dies.
Hide: Spend 1 action to avoid combat.
Mandatory if wolf present, streamlining decision pressure.
Interact
Trade resources/prey with players on the same tile (free action).
Fight another player: Both roll d8. Higher roll wins (resources can modify rolls).
Encourages negotiation and conflict without redundant systems.
Simplified Board Turn

Ecosystem Phase
Resources Regrow: If a tile has ≥1 resource, add 1 (max 3).
Prey Multiply: If a tile has ≥2 prey, add 1 (max 3). Excess prey migrate to adjacent tiles.
Wolves Hunt:
Wolves move toward tiles with the most prey.
If a wolf shares a tile with ≥3 prey, spawn a new wolf on an adjacent tile.
Survival Phase
Each meeple consumes 1 prey. Starvation occurs if unmet.
New Meeples: Players gain 1 meeple per settlement (instead of automatic growth).
Wolf Attacks
Unhidden meeples on wolf tiles automatically trigger combat (use Defend rules).
Key Changes for Learning Objectives

Tragedy of the Commons
Over-hunting prey reduces regeneration. Wolves multiply if prey is abundant, creating feedback loops.
Players must balance short-term gains vs. long-term survival.
Negotiation & Collaboration
Trading replaces "Drop Resource," incentivizing deals.
Shared threats (wolves) encourage alliances.
Population Dynamics
Meeples grow via settlements (not automatic), linking expansion to resource investment.
Wolves and prey replicate based on thresholds, simulating ecological systems.
Simplified Combat
Unified d8 mechanics for hunting, wolves, and PvP. Resources can modify rolls (e.g., +1 per resource spent).
Benefits

Reduced Cognitive Load: Fewer actions and unified mechanics.
Enhanced Strategy: Settlements drive growth, requiring resource management.
Clearer Feedback Loops: Prey/wolf dynamics directly tie to player decisions.
Business Alignment: Easier to teach in workshops, with clearer systems for case studies.
Testing Notes

Monitor player strategies to ensure the streamlined rules still allow for emergent complexity.
Adjust wolf migration/prey thresholds if predation feels too punitive.
This redesign maintains systemic depth while focusing on the core objectives of collaboration, resource management, and ecological interdependence.
