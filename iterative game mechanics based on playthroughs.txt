Game Rules and Mechanics
Test Round One: (5 Rounds)
Revealing Rule:
Ability to share resources with other players.
Standard Rule:
Each meeple adds one more action.
Test Round Two: (10 Rounds)
Standard Rules:
Can pass over a tile without revealing.
Hiding from a wolf.
Battle with wolves occurs as an action like other actions.
Start with 3 Resources.
No reveal of the tile you place your settlement.
Revealing Rules:
Can pass through space between the tiles.
Place a resource/rabbit on a tile and it will multiply. If you place two rabbits, the normal rules apply.
You can eat the other player (1 prey) if you win a fight.
Additional Standard Rule:
Three Rabbits + wolf = new wolf & new rabbit, wolf moves to where rabbit goes.
Test Round Three: (10 Rounds)
Standard Rules:
Each settlement spawns a settlement.
Resources do not spread.
New rabbits go where other rabbits are.
Considerations:
Rules for which tile newly spawned things go: toward resources, away from players, or clockwise from the top.
If wolves are extinct, what do we do? Consider the number of starting wolves.
If you build a settlement on a tile with three rabbits, wolves will not spawn.
Better way to remember what was consumed in the previous round.
Standard Rule (Tentative):
Tiles are created when a meeple moves off an existing tile into a new space. In the unoccupied space, move in, place a new tile, read the number on the tile, and place resources.
