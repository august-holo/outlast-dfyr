# OUTLAST: Official Game Rules

## Game Overview
Outlast is a survival board game where players control meeples to gather resources, build settlements, and survive against predators and other players.

## Player Turn
Each player gets **3 actions** per turn, plus **1 extra action** for each additional meeple they control.

### Actions
Players can choose from the following actions during their turn:

#### 1. Move
- Travel to an adjacent tile
- Reveal the tile if it is face down

#### 2. Gather Resources
- If a tile has resources, spend 1 action per resource to collect them

#### 3. Hunt Prey
*Available only if there is no wolf on the tile*
- Spend 1 action and roll an 8-sided die (d8):
  - Roll 5-8: Success (You catch prey)
  - Roll 1-4: Failure (You miss)

#### 4. Fight a Predator
*Mandatory if a wolf is on the same tile as a meeple*
- Roll a d8:
  - Roll 7-8: Victory (You defeat the predator)
  - Roll 1-6: Death (You do not survive)

#### 5. Hide
- Use 1 action to avoid predator attacks

#### 6. Build
- Spend 3 resources to construct something

#### 7. Drop Resource
- If you drop a resource/prey on a full tile, the resource/prey will go to a free adjacent tile

#### 8. Fight Another Player
- If you are on the same tile as another meeple, you can choose to fight them
- Both players roll d8, the higher number wins
- Both players can add resources to change their roll

### Special Rules
- A meeple spawns at the settlements
- If a wolf is on the same tile as a meeple, the meeple must take one of two actions (Fight a Predator or Hide) on their turn
- If all actions are used and a meeple is still on a tile with a wolf, the meeple will be forced to fight the wolf

### End of Turn
- Each meeple consumes one prey per turn
- If there is no prey for a meeple to consume, they starve and are removed from the board

## Board Turn
After all players have taken their turns, the board takes a turn. The following events occur in order:

### 1. Resources Grow
- Resources regenerate, but only if at least one resource remains on a tile
- A tile with 0 resources will not regenerate
- Each tile can hold a maximum of 3 resources

### 2. Prey Multiply
- If 2 or more prey are on a tile, one additional prey appears
- Maximum of 3 prey per tile
- A single prey on a tile does not multiply
- If a tile already has 3 prey, a new prey is added to an adjacent tile
- Subsequent prey will continue to be added to the same adjacent tile until it also reaches 3 prey

### 3. Wolves Move
- Wolves move toward the nearest tile that contains prey

### 4. Wolves Multiply
- If a tile has 3 prey and 1 wolf, a new wolf appears
- Only 1 wolf can occupy a tile at any time
- The new wolf moves to an adjacent tile with the largest number of prey

### 5. New People Arrive
- Each player receives one new meeple to add to their group

### 6. Wolf Attacks
- If a player is on the same tile as a wolf and did not choose to hide, the wolf attacks

Once the board turn is complete, a new round begins with the player turn phase.
